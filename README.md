# Android Clean Architecture with MVVM

Welcome to this comprehensive repository showcasing **Clean Architecture** combined with the **MVVM** pattern for Android development! This project is designed for developers who want to build scalable, testable, and maintainable Android applications using the latest technologies.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Clean Architecture**: Decoupled layers for maximum flexibility and testability.
- **MVVM Pattern**: Separates UI logic from business logic, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.
- **Modern Technologies**:
  - **Coroutines + Flow/StateFlow**: Efficient handling of asynchronous data streams.
  - **Hilt/Dagger**: Simplified dependency injection.
  - **Room**: Seamless local data persistence with SQLite.
  - **Retrofit/Ktor-client**: Reliable network operations.
  - **Jetpack Compose**: Fully declarative UI for modern Android apps.
- **Typography Guidelines**: Centralized and customizable typography for consistent UI design.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

This project follows Clean Architecture principles, dividing responsibilities into clearly defined layers:

```
├── domain        // Business logic and use cases
├── data          // Data sources (e.g., APIs, local database)
├── presentation  // ViewModels and UI components (Jetpack Compose)
├── di            // Dependency Injection setup (Hilt/Dagger)
```

Each layer interacts through well-defined interfaces, ensuring loose coupling and testability.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

### Core

- **Kotlin**: Modern, concise, and expressive language for Android.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Declarative UI toolkit for faster and easier UI development.

### Asynchronous Programming

- **Coroutines**: Lightweight threads for seamless background tasks.
- **Flow/StateFlow**: Reactive streams for observing data changes efficiently.

### Dependency Injection

- **Hilt/Dagger**: Simplify dependency injection with reduced boilerplate.

### Persistence

- **Room**: Abstraction over SQLite for local storage.

### Networking

- **Retrofit/Ktor-client**: Simplified API calls with robust error handling.

### Design Guidelines

- **Material Design 3**: Ensure visually appealing and user-friendly apps.
- **Centralized Styles**: Define typography, colors, and themes in a single place for easy updates across the app.

## ✨ Typography & Theming

The project includes centralized typography and theme management for consistent UI. Modify a single source of truth to:

- Update primary colors across the app.
- Change font sizes for specific elements like titles, buttons, and captions.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Flamingo (or later)
- Kotlin 1.7+ and Gradle 7.0+

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clean-architecture-mvvm
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Sync Gradle and build the project.
4. Run the app on an emulator or physical device.

## 💡 Why Choose This Boilerplate?

This project eliminates the repetitive task of setting up a new Android project by providing:

- Predefined Clean Architecture structure.
- Seamless integration with modern libraries and tools.
- Centralized theme and typography management.

With this boilerplate, you can focus on building features rather than reinventing the wheel.
